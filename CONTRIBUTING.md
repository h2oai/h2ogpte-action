# Contributing to h2oGPTe GitHub Action

## Development Guide

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Access to h2oGPTe API (if required)

### Installation

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (JavaScript runtime and package manager).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `bun install` to install dependencies.
4. Install the pre-commit configuration `pre-commit install` (ensure you've installed [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) first).
5. Run `bun run test` to run unit tests. See `package.json` for more bun scripts.

## Contribution Guide

We welcome contributions! To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**

   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create your own copy.

2. **Create a feature branch with a descriptive name**

   - Use clear, descriptive names for your branches, such as:
     - `feature/add-image-support`
     - `fix/typo-in-readme`
     - `chore/update-dependencies`

3. **Make your changes and commit with clear messages**

4. **Submit a pull request (PR) from your feature branch to a feature branch in the upstream repository**

   - Do not submit PRs directly to the `main` branch. Maintainers will review and merge feature branches into `main` as appropriate.

5. **Request a review from a maintainer**
   - Tag a maintainer in your PR or use GitHub's review request feature.
