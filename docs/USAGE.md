# Usage

The h2oGPTe GitHub Action integrates AI assistance directly into your GitHub workflow. Simply tag `@h2ogpte` in any comment, issue, or pull request, and the agent will provide intelligent feedback and assistance.

## üí¨ Basic Usage

### üîç Pull Request Comment

Leave a comment in a pull request mentioning `@h2ogpte` to trigger the action and receive AI-powered feedback.

Example:

```text
@h2ogpte Can you review the changes in this PR and suggest improvements?
```

### üêõ Issue Comment

Mention `@h2ogpte` in an issue comment to get help or suggestions related to the issue.

Example:

```text
@h2ogpte What are the possible causes for this bug?
```

### üìù New Issue or PR Body

You can also mention `@h2ogpte` directly in the body of a new issue or pull request to automatically trigger the workflow.

Example:

```text
This PR refactors the authentication logic. @h2ogpte please check for security issues.
```

### üñºÔ∏è Adding Images

You can attach images to your comments or issues for h2oGPTe to analyze. For example, you might upload a screenshot of an error or a diagram:

Example:

```text
@h2ogpte Can you help me understand this error?
[image attachment]
```

**Note:** You can also upload other file types, but due to [GitHub restrictions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/162417#discussioncomment-13428503), only images can be processed by h2oGPTe. Other file types will be ignored.

## üìö Custom Workflows

### üîç Automatic Pull Request Review ([h2ogpte_auto_pr.yaml](../examples/custom_workflows/h2ogpte_auto_pr.yaml))

Provides automated code review for pull requests. The agent analyzes your changes to identify potential issues, suggest improvements, and highlight best practices. It creates detailed review comments with specific recommendations without modifying your code directly.

### üìã Automatic Issue Context ([h2ogpte_auto_issue_context.yaml](../examples/custom_workflows/h2ogpte_auto_issue_context.yaml))

Provides instant developer onboarding for new issues. When someone opens an issue, the agent immediately scans the codebase and comments with a roadmap showing which files are involved, what changes might be needed, and implementation suggestions. Perfect for helping new contributors understand where to start working.

### üìö Automatic Documentation Generation ([h2ogpte_auto_docs.yaml](../examples/custom_workflows/h2ogpte_auto_docs.yaml))

Maintains comprehensive documentation standards across your repository. This workflow automatically reviews pull requests and generates appropriate documentation including docstrings, inline comments, and README updates to ensure code changes are properly documented. It adheres to existing documentation conventions while preserving all existing functionality.

### üß™ Automatic Test Generation ([h2ogpte_auto_test.yaml](../examples/custom_workflows/h2ogpte_auto_test.yaml))

Ensures your code changes never ship without proper test coverage. The agent reviews each pull request, identifies untested code paths, and automatically creates comprehensive test files that cover edge cases and follow your project's testing conventions. It only adds tests - never modifies existing code.

See [examples](../examples/custom_workflows) of more custom workflow configurations.

## üéØ Custom Prompting

The action also supports custom prompting for specialized workflows.

When using custom prompts, you can inject the following variables into your prompt text:

| Variable         | Description                                                                                                             | Example Usage                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{repoName}}`   | The name of the repository                                                                                              | `You must only work in the user's repository, {{repoName}}` |
| `{{idNumber}}`   | The pull request or issue number                                                                                        | `on pull request number {{idNumber}}`                       |
| `{{eventsText}}` | Chronological list of previous events, including pull request/issue comments and commit history separated by new lines. | `Here are the previous events: {{eventsText}}`              |

These variables are automatically populated by the action and help provide context-aware responses.
