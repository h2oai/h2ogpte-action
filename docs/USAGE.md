```

**Note:** You can also upload other file types, but due to [GitHub restrictions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/162417#discussioncomment-13428503), only images can be processed by h2oGPTe. Other file types will be ignored.

## üéØ Custom Prompting

The action also supports custom prompting for specialized workflows.

When using custom prompts, you can inject the following variables into your prompt text:

| Variable         | Description                                                                                                             | Example Usage                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{repoName}}`   | The name of the repository                                                                                              | `You must only work in the user's repository, {{repoName}}` |
| `{{idNumber}}`   | The pull request or issue number                                                                                        | `on pull request number {{idNumber}}`                       |
| `{{eventsText}}` | Chronological list of previous events, including pull request/issue comments and commit history separated by new lines. | `Here are the previous events: {{eventsText}}`              |

These variables are automatically populated by the action and help provide context-aware responses.
