# h2oGPTe GitHub Action

A GitHub Action that integrates h2oGPTe AI assistant into your workflow for automated code reviews and suggestions.

## Overview

The h2oGPTe GitHub Action reduces manual effort by:

1. Automating code review responses through AI
2. Eliminating the need to switch contexts by providing feedback directly in pull requests
3. Allowing developers to get instant feedback by simply mentioning @h2ogpte in comments
4. Providing detailed analysis of code changes with repository context awareness

The solution helps developers better understand issues by:

1. Analyzing code in the context of the specific repository
2. Providing AI-powered insights about code changes
3. Maintaining conversation history for complex issues
4. Including relevant file paths and code context in the analysis

## Out-of-the-Box Implementation

These tests verify that the h2oGPTe GitHub Action can be implemented in any GitHub repository with minimal configuration. The only requirements are:

1. GitHub Actions enabled in the repository
2. h2oGPTe API key and base URL configured as secrets (by default use [internal dedicated](https://h2ogpte.internal.dedicated.h2o.ai))
3. GitHub token with appropriate permissions

Once configured, developers can immediately start using the AI-powered code review capabilities by simply mentioning @h2ogpte in their pull request review comments.

## Developer Guide

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Access to h2oGPTe API (if required)

### Installation

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (JavaScript runtime and package manager)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `bun install` to install dependencies
4. Install the pre-commit configuration `pre-commit install` (ensure you've installed [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) first)

### Usage

Currently we can only run the action from our own GH repository: `.github/workflows/h2ogpte.yml`

### Local Testing

To test the action locally:

```bash
bun run test-action
```
