# h2oGPTe GitHub Action

> A GitHub Action that integrates h2oGPTe AI assistant into your workflow for automated code reviews and suggestions.

## Overview

The h2oGPTe GitHub Action reduces manual effort by:

1. Automating code review responses through AI
2. Eliminating the need to switch contexts by providing feedback directly in pull requests
3. Allowing developers to get instant feedback by simply mentioning @h2ogpte in comments
4. Providing detailed analysis of code changes with repository context awareness

The solution helps developers better understand issues by:

1. Analysing code in the context of the specific repository
2. Providing AI-powered insights about code changes
3. Maintaining conversation history for complex issues
4. Including relevant file paths and code context in the analysis

## Installation Guide

> **Note:** This GitHub Action will only work for repositories linked to the h2o.ai enterprise organization (i.e., h2oai-owned or enterprise-connected repositories).

To install the h2oGPTe Agent Assistant GitHub Action in your repository:

1. **Add the Workflow File**

   - Copy the file at `examples/h2ogpte.yaml` from this repository into your own repository at `.github/workflows/h2ogpte.yaml`.

2. **Add the h2oGPTe API Key as a Repository Secret**
   - In your repository on GitHub, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
   - Click **New repository secret**.
   - Set the name to `H2OGPTE_API_KEY`.
   - Paste your h2oGPTe API key as the value.
   - Click **Add secret**.

Once these steps are complete, the workflow will be triggered automatically on issues, pull requests, and comments that mention `@h2ogpte`. See below for more details on use cases.

### Compatibility

Currently, only h2ogpte version >= 1.6.31 is supported. By default, the action uses `https://h2ogpte.internal.dedicated.h2o.ai` as the API base. If you wish to use a different h2ogpte environment, set the `h2ogpte_api_base` input in your workflow file (see `action.yml` for details).
