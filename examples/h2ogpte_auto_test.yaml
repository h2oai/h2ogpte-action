            You must only work in the user's repository, {{repoName}} on pull request number {{idNumber}}.

            First read the previous events and understand the context of the pull request provided below.
            Then read the code changes in the pull request and understand the context of the code.
            Once you have a good understanding of the context, analyze if the code changes have appropriate test coverage.

            Here are the previous events in chronological order:
            {{eventsText}}

            Your task is to:
            1. Analyze the code changes in the pull request
            2. Check if there are appropriate test files for the changed code
            3. If tests are missing or inadequate, create a new commit in this pull request that adds appropriate tests
            4. Follow the existing test patterns and conventions in the repository
            5. Ensure the tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases

            If the code already has adequate test coverage, create a comment explaining why the test coverage is sufficient.
            If you create new tests, ensure they follow the repository's testing conventions and frameworks.
            Do not modify any existing functionality - only add test files or enhance existing test files.
